# THE SUMMER RIP
A Hack the Dot project.

The Summer Rip was completed by 5 crazy developers in just 90 minutes. It took first place at the Hack the Dot - Summer is Dead Edition hack-a-thon in Seattle on 8/10/16.

##It's a simple but fun experience.

Our character is wearing **long pants** on the beach in summer and he's getting very hot.

Help him out by **clicking on his pant legs**.
